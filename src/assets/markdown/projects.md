## Image-Based Voice-Controlled Chessboard

The project upgrades chess games by using computer vision and voice recognition.
Analyzing a screenshot image, we detect the chessboard grid and piece. We also recognize the different chess pieces. The best part? You can just tell the board to move a piece using your voice!

It's a fun and easy way to play chess, making it more awesome for everyone.
